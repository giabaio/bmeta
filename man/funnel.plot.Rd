\title{Funnel plot to examine publication bias}
\usage{
funnel.plot(x, xlab = NULL, ylab = NULL, title = NULL, xlim = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a \code{bmeta} object with results of the model}

\item{xlab}{title of x-axis. If unspecified, the function sets an
appropriate lable by default.}

\item{ylab}{title of x-axis. If unspecified, the function sets an
appropriate lable by default.}

\item{title}{title of the plot if specified}

\item{xlim}{horozontal limits of the plot region. If unspecified, the
function sets the horizontal plot limits to (-6,6).}
}
\description{
Function to examine publication bias. For both fixed- and random-effects
models, estimates from no-pooling effects model are used as study-specific
estimates. For random-effects models, the corresponding fixed-effects models
are implemented at background to obtain pooled estimate. For example, if
users call \code{bmeta} to run random-effects meta-analysis with normal
prior, fixed-effects meta-analysis with normal prior are implemented at
background to obtain pooled estimate for graphing. In the absence of
publication and heterogeneity, the scatter resembles a symmetrical funnel
and the triangle area formed by connecting the centred summary estimate with
its 2.5\% and 97.5\% quantiles on either side includes about 95\% of the
studies if the fixed-effects model assumption holds (i.e. all the studies
estimate the same effect).

\examples{

### Read and format the data (binary)
data = read.csv(url("https://gianluca.statistica.it/software/bmeta/Data-bin.csv"))

### List data for binary outcome 
data.list <- list(y0=data$y0,y1=data$y1,n0=data$n0,n1=data$n1) 

### Select random-effects meta-analysis with t-distribution prior for binary
### data
x <- bmeta(data.list, outcome="bin", model="std.dt", type="ran")

### using output from bmeta to produce funnel plot 
funnel.plot(x)

### using output from bmeta and specify title of the plot 
funnel.plot(x,title="funnel plot")

### using output from bmeta and specify the limit of x-axis and title
funnel.plot(x,title="funnel plot",xlim=c(-2,1))

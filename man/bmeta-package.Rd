\title{bmeta: A Bayesian Meta-Analysis Package for R}
\description{
The bmeta package provides a collection of functions for conducting
meta-analyses under Bayesian context in R. The package includes functions
for computing various effect size or outcome measures (e.g. odds ratios,
mean difference and incidence rate ratio) for different types of data based
on MCMC simulations. Users are allowed to fit fixed- and random-effects
models with different priors to the data. Meta-regression can be carried out
if effects of additional covariates are observed. Furthermore, the package
provides functions for creating posterior distribution plots and forest plot
to display main model output. Traceplots and some other diagnostic plots are
also available for assessing model fit and performance.

yes\cr } Bayesian meta-analysis is becoming more frequently accepted as a
statistical approach for evidence synthesis from multiple studies in health
research. The Bayesian methods differ inherently from frequentist ones by
assuming that model parameters are random quantities. Therefore, prior
distributions for model parameters can be specified, which are normally
based on external evidence. The bmeta function provides 22 models with
commonly used priors for fitting different types of data (i.e. binary,
continuous and count data).
